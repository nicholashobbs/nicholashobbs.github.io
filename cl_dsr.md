Hiring Team
Diller Scofidio + Renfro
Starrett-Lehigh Building
New York, NY

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest to work for Diller Scofidio + Renfro, a firm whose work in integrating architecture, outdoor space, and technology has long inspired me. With my background in data science, software engineering, and operations management, as well as recent work learning 3D modeling and architectural design, I believe I could make important contributions to your team. My experience in developing data-driven tools, optimizing workflows, and creating interactive visualizations, and recently my attempts to improve my 3d modeling skills, have prepared me for a role where I can leverage technical skills and develop my creative abilities.

In my previous roles, I have consistently targeted and learned new technical skills to improve my abilities to process and build user interactions for complex data sources. As a Software Engineer at Off Piste, I developed applications using Rust and Solana, focusing on memory safety and efficient smart contracts, while also contributing to front-end design with D3 and React to create engaging user experiences. My work as a Data Scientist at Openlattice involved building graph databases and custom API endpoints, as well as utilizing BERT for data deduplication—skills that could translate seamlessly into managing complex architectural data or optimizing design workflows. Additionally, my experience as an Operations Manager at Lefty’s Bar and Grill honed my ability to implement data-driven strategies, automate processes, and improve operational efficiency.

What excites me most about DS+R is your ability to create environments that blend functionality with artistic expression, as seen in projects like the High Line. In my career so far, I have worked on similar problems, but in virtual space. Now I am working toward realizing my dream of translating these skills into physical reality through architecture. As I work toward pursuing formal education in architecture, I am eager to contribute to your team by applying my technical skills in data analysis, software development, and 3D modeling to support your projects. My 3D portfolio, linked above, showcases my exploration of spatial design and interactive environments.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to discuss how my skills and experiences align with DS+R’s mission and projects. Please feel free to contact me at (801) 664-7021 or nicholas.r.hobbs@gmail.com to schedule a conversation. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your projects and learning from the innovative work of DS+R.


Sincerely,  
**Nicholas Hobbs**
