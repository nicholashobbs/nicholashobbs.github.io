Start from ground up with new d3-based mindmap. Organize all information hierarchically.

Start with categories and sources. Find overlap. Do a quick overview of everything and then add on detail as you continue. Value consistency over getting everything "right" at first. 

BBH stuff is top priority.

Second is Linux, CompSci background stuff.

Finally, and later when it is more relevant, specific areas within BBH, data science skills, and other things which will give you sharper tools to use.

To be good at bbh, you need the ability to write with bash, python, go, know how technologies work, and design things with specificity to get it going properly.
