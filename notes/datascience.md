# linear algebra
## scalar
a single numerical value
## vector
a set of numerical values
## matrix
a set of sets of numerical values
## tensor
a tensor is a structure containing n dimensions of data - a matrix, for example, is a 2 dimensional tensor. A sca

# neural networks
Neuron computes weighted sum of inputs:

$Y=activationfunction(\sum(weight*input) + bias)$

## activation function
activation function is typically RELU in modern applications - the identity function above 0 and 0 for x<0



## patterns/features/weights
activations of the neurons in a given layer

## input layer 
beginning of a neural network that brings initial data into the system

## bias
constant which is added to the product of features and weights

## hidden layer
### units/neurons
## output layer

## supervised learning

## self supervised learning

## reinforcement learning
agents interact with environments through actions, recieving rewards and observations in return

## transfer learning
using a model that has already learned foundational patterns

## seq2seq
learning algorithm which translates from one sequence to another

## classification 
predicting whether something is one thing or another

## epoch
one complete pass of the training dataset
